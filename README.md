# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
In this code, the user is prompted to enter the credit card number, owner, transaction amount, and location. The input is then validated using a series of checks:

The is_valid_credit_card_number function checks if the entered credit card number is a valid number.
The is_valid_credit_card_owner function checks if the entered credit card owner's name matches the name on the card.
The is_valid_transaction_amount function checks if the transaction amount is within the card's limit.
The is_valid_transaction_location function checks if the transaction location is within the cardholder's usual locations.
Based on the result of these checks, the transaction is either approved or declined.
